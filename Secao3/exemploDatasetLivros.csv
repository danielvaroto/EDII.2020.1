If you have doubts or questions about the Hill case or alien bexperiences in general, Captured! will give you the answers you're searching for. The 1961 abduction of the Hills stirred worldwide interest, primarily because of the book The Interrupted Journey, the subsequent media coverage, and a 1975 TV movie, The UFO Incident. The case is mentioned in almost all UFO abduction books. It also became a target for debunkers, who still attack it today. But the complete story of what really happened that day, its effect on the participants, and the findings of investigators has never been told...until now. In Captured! you'll get an insider's look at the alien abduction, previously unpublished information about the lives of the Hills before and after Barney's death in 1969, their status as celebrities, Betty's experiences as a UFO investigator, and other activities before her death in 2004. Kathleen Marden, Betty Hill's niece, shares details from her discussions with Betty and from the evidence of the UFO abduction. She also looks at the Hills' riveting hypnosis sessions about their time onboard the spacecraft. The transcripts of these sessions provide insight into the character of the aliens, including their curiosity, their democratic discussions, and their desire to avoid inflicting pain. In addition, co-author, physicist, and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman, the original civilian investigator of the Roswell Incident, reviews and refutes the arguments of those who have attacked the Hill case, including the star map Betty Hill saw inside the craft and later recreated.","152.0","229.0","20.0","","","","1","9781564149718","","1a92434fad56f316f8f6504862c85647","full/e/e/c/eec9d7ad58243fa66c6a57c2a2bf7067a2aa6fa2.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/5641/9781564149718.jpg","","","1564149714","9781564149718","en","2007-09-14 00:00:00","","3.78","315","Captured! the Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience : The True Story of the World's First Documented Alien Abduction","/Captured-Betty-Barney-Hill-UFO-Experience-Stanton-T-Friedman/9781564149718","521.63"

Farrell here delves ever deeper into the activities of this nefarious group. In his previous works, Farrell has clearly demonstrated that the Nazis were clandestinely developing new and amazing technologies toward the end of WWII, and that the key scientists involved in these experiments were exported to the Allied countries at the end of the conflict, mainly the United States, in a move called Operation Paperclip. NASA director and developer of the Saturn V rocket that sent Americans to the moon, Werner von Braun, was one of these scientists. Farrell has traced the links between ongoing Reich activities and the newly-formed CIA and other defense/ military/ industrial establishments. Now, Farrell has meticulously reviewed the best-known Roswell research from UFO-ET advocates and skeptics alike, as well as some little-known source material, and comes to a radically different scenario of what happened in Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947, and why the US military has continued to cover it up to this day. Farrell presents a fascinating case sure to disturb both ET believers and disbelievers, namely, that what crashed may have been representative of an independent postwar Nazi power-an extraterritorial Reich monitoring its old enemy, America, and the continuing development of the very technologies confiscated from Germany at the end of the War.","152.0","229.0","28.96","","","","1","9781935487050","","adae72e7f26f1ffc8aca7c0e11f1a23b","full/9/f/5/9f5b286f9720b123e39500935ff325f820abf648.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9354/9781935487050.jpg","","","1935487051","9781935487050","en","2013-09-11 00:00:00","","4.3","55","Roswell and the Reich : The Nazi Connection","/Roswell-Reich-Joseph-P-Farrell/9781935487050","734.82"

For sixty years, scientists and the public have debated the answer to this question, yet none have considered what Samael Aun Weor explains in Cosmic Ships: ""We are absolutely sure that the cannibals from Africa and the Amazon also felt very annoyed when they could not manage to capture an explorer. Regarding concrete facts about flying saucers, people want to proceed like cannibals, however, it is clear that the crews of those cosmic ships-who know human savagery very well-are not willing to let themselves be ensnared, since they very well know the fortune that awaits them, that is, the intellectual-loafers would make them prisoners, the ships would be seized and used for war, etc."" Logical analysis of the facts demonstrates not only the existence of advanced humanities, but their presence on our planet. There are thousands of documented cases of unexplained ships on our planet, hundreds of cases of governments hiding the facts from the public, and decades of an attempt to encourage the populace to discard the facts as fantasy or foolishness. Through stories from his own experience and analysis of well-known events, Samael Aun Weor shows that much of what we believe about extraterrestrials is false, based on fear, stubborn skepticism, and outright lies. He explains how easy it is for advanced humanities to hide from us, and why they must: because we are so consumed by psychological defects like pride, greed, and envy that we are a danger to ourselves and the universe. It is for this reason that they are here: to understand why we are such savages, and how to help us change for the better. It is time for us to stop trying to capture or destroy them, and welcome their assistance.","108.0","171.0","13.72","","","","1","9781934206393","","25a5692544f0abdcc9e21bcb8adbb811","full/f/f/6/ff68b53ab118b1b89fc193392e7b8c21c4e97603.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/9342/9781934206393.jpg","","","1934206393","9781934206393","en","2011-07-29 00:00:00","","4.14","28","Cosmic Ships : Truth and Lies About Ufos, Other Humanities, and Our Future","/Cosmic-Ships-Samael-Aun-Weor/9781934206393","190.51"

Fairy tales - the stories of this kingdom - are not only folk literature but also accounts of the subtler layers of fact clothed in poetic imagery. Rudolf Steiner was a close observer of the fairy kingdom and gave many lectures that describe the work of its inhabitants, whom he called elementals. It was clear to Steiner that these elementals were of great importance to the Earth, charged not only with the maintenance of Nature's household, but also with her evolutionary plans. He also spoke of how vital it is that we get to know these fairy workers and honor the work they do, so that their efforts prosper to carry the Earth forward in its evolution. Written and illustrated by two insightful women who experienced the fairy kingdom directly, this book offers a profound, yet simple introduction to fairy worlds and workers.

In this book French explains the meaning and purpose of these shapes, how they mould our reality and perception of it, and how they have a direct bearing on what you are and why you are here.  These shapes and symbols contain messages that have been consistently represented in religion, philosophy, mythology, mysticism, the arts and sciences. Their messages are built into our genetic make-up and we recognise them instinctively. The book is divided up into three parts. Part 1 covers the properties of the basic geometric shapes and numbers. Part 2 describes how these in turn form layers of construction, creating principals that are fundamental to the purpose of the universe. The spiral sustains reality, the cross highlighting the central point of existence and the Heart where we weigh up our choices. Part 3 describes how we can use these principles to create positive change in our lives by helping us to expand our awareness of reality.","187.0","246.0","20.0","","","","1","9781780286815","Illustrations (colour)","15ad0c33cfc3709eb3278de5afa98c31","full/7/8/c/78c5e9b0e3fac62d06f4feb4d554a31e2fbe9847.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/7802/9781780286815.jpg","Watkins Publishing","","1780286813","9781780286815","en","2014-05-20 00:00:00","","5.0","1","Gateway To The Heavens","/Gateway-Heavens-Karen-French/9781780286815","802.0"

"[42, 43]","525873","[2848]","As Alive, So Dead is a collection of memoirs by a woman with a unique ability: she can see and talk to ghosts. Because of this, she is able to write a book that shows the human side of the paranormal-stories about ghosts told from the perspectives of the ghosts themselves. Recounting the stories of those who have died in a variety of ways, As Alive, So Dead looks at death through the eyes of the victims of murder, suicide, and accident, as well as glimpses into the afterlife of Native Americans, patients kept alive on life-support, and even animals. Far from the sensationalized tales of most ghost lore, As Alive, So Dead presents real stories of troubled people-both the living and the dead-not simply the terror of sinister manifestations. As Alive, So Dead is a lesson on death and the immortality of the spirit that only someone who can actually speak with the deceased could teach. Originally published in 2000 with a limited run, As Alive, So Dead sold out immediately and had been out of print ever since. Over the next decade, Mary Ann Winkowski inspired and served as a consultant to TV's Ghost Whisperer, which starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and ran on CBS for five seasons. She also published four additional books, including When Ghosts Speak; Beyond Delicious: The Ghost Whisperer's Cookbook; and two works of fiction based on her experiences. Despite this, the one thing she has been repeatedly asked by fans and clients over the years is where they can get a copy of her first memoir: As Alive, So Dead. Finally back in print, these requests can now be filled. The second edition of As Alive, So Dead has been reformatted for better readability and includes the last names of Mary Ann and her ghostwriter, David Powers, who previously left their last names off the book and published it simply as Mary Ann and David Christopher.","140.0","216.0","10.0","","2nd ed.","","1","9781929309108","","eeda8fb1d3f233f1cc277451be72c996","full/4/3/6/4360f44e5119e4e6158e8c5e040825dbd75a3cd6.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9293/9781929309108.jpg","","","1929309104","9781929309108","en","2011-11-08 00:00:00","","4.22","27","As Alive, So Dead : Investigating the Paranormal","/Alive-So-Dead-David-Powers/9781929309108","218.0"

When the Bruins played their first game in 1924, hockey was already a staple of the Boston sports scene. It was the prospect of attracting the capacity crowds that supported Boston's local club and college teams that lured Charles F. Adams to invest in the franchise. The Bruins were both an outgrowth of local tradition and a manifestation of the ambitions of the NHL. Their roster has included the likes of Eddie Shore, ""Dit"" Clapper, and the greatest player of all time, Bobby Orr. The photographs in The Bruins in Black and White: 1924-1966, the first of a two-volume illustrated history, document the success of Charles F. Adams's investment and the achievements of players who proudly wore the Bruins colors. Their passion, commitment, and love of the game are evident on every page.","171.0","248.0","25.0","","","","1","9780738534855","","df5638b849589fcf3622de22242a104d","full/b/c/0/bc025788a1b3c59e61d95d8adbd93815ab99c8ae.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7385/9780738534855.jpg","","","738534854","9780738534855","en","2003-12-09 00:00:00","","4.0","1","The Bruins in Black and White : 1924-1966","/Bruins-Black-White-Richard-Johnson/9780738534855","299.0"

The good news is we are not alone and there is a plan and there are ways to get this. It is your souls plan that you came into this life and into soul incarnation with. Your Akashic Records have the blueprint to your souls plan, the Book of Truth is the gateway out of the illusion of the dream world weve been told is the real world, and Akashic Enlightenment is the key and gateway to both leading you to your highest true soul self and a life of joy, abundance, freedom, peace and love. Through your own Akashic Records and the Book of Truth via Akashic Enlightenment you will be shown the divine wisdom and knowledge of your past, present, and future lives, alignment with your true soul self and the true laws of the universe as created by Creator / Source / God / All That Is outside of any illusory realities created by you or society. You will be helped to better understand and become self aware of who you really are as your highest true soul self and how your soul is experiencing the Ascension, or self awareness unveiling, underway at this time. You will clear old energy and/or thought patterns, stepping out of fears, traumas, and anxieties on all levels helping you move along and follow your souls path of higher awareness. Ultimately, strengthening your soul alignment to be and maintain your highest true self as this is truly the greatest service you can do for yourself and thus for anyone or anything else.

A few months later it was seen again, and the witness said: ""It was like a big owl with pointed ears, as big as a man. The eyes were red and glowing. At first I thought that it someone dressed-up, playing a joke, trying to scare us. I laughed at it. We both did. Then it went up in the air and we both screamed. When it went up you could see its feet were like pincers!"" Her friend added some details of her own: ""It's true. It was horrible, a nasty owl-face with big ears and big red eyes. It was covered in grey feathers. The claws on its feet were black. It just flew up and disappeared in the trees."" These were the first of a series of sightings of what has become known as 'The Owlman of Mawnan' - a series of sightings that has continued to the present day. These grotesque and frightening episodes have fascinated researchers for three decades now, and one man has spent years collecting all the available evidence into a book. To mark the 30th anniversary of these sightings, Jonathan Downes, the Director of the Centre for Fortean Zoology - the world's largest mystery animal research group - has published a special edition of his book 'The Owlman and Others' which was first published in 1997. A witness who saw the creature in 1995 likened it to""a vision from hell"", and another witness (identified only as `Gavin`) describes how his Owlman sighting in 1989 has blighted his life ever since. The book also tells the story of Morgawr - the Cornish Sea Serpent, and the summer of 1976, which was not only the hottest on record, but was the year that the whole of southern Cornwall went crazy! ""I have explored various explanations for the events in the book"" says Jon, ""and I am not completely sure which one is true. But I know one thing for sure. I wouldn't let my children play alone in those woods....""","189.0","246.0","18.0","","","","1","9781905723027","black & white illustrations","8e820a1bdeb17b9828a95728d5d8e1cf","full/9/5/b/95b819482fdabdf34901e7ea410f832a93a62c3a.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/9057/9781905723027.jpg","","","1905723024","9781905723027","en","2006-04-30 00:00:00","","4.0","24","The Owlman and Others","/Owlman-Others-Jonathan-Downes/9781905723027","616.0"

World War II would grip the world with terror for six years. During that time military personnel reported seeing numerous highly unconventional aircraft in all theaters of operation. These objects had extraordinary flight performance capabilities, came in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and were able to travel at extraordinary speeds and avoid radar detection. ""Strange Company"" is the first in-depth account of unconventional aircraft observed and reported by the military during World War II. It includes the reactions by military commands, their viewpoints, and theories as they struggled to make sense of the observations. Strange Company presents one of the greatest wartime mysteries, one that has been shrouded in ignorance for more than sixty years.

Dellschau literally spent the last 20 years of his life closeted away in an attic apartment, creating a fantastical body of art that continues to fascinate. Indeed, today Dellschau is recognized as one of America's leading visionary artists, ranked alongside such world luminaries as Henry Darger and Adolf Wol i. A single page of one of his notebooks now fetches thousands of dollars - and there are thousands of such pages, frenetic productivity being a hallmark of visionary artists. But Dellschau's work - consisting of ink and watercolor illustrations of fanciful flying machines to which he frequently pasted newspaper clippings, or ""press blooms"" as he called them - appears to tell a coherent story of the Sonora (California) Aero Club. Using an anti-gravity gas purportedly invented by one of its members, The Club allegedly turned out a series of experimental aircraft some 50 years before the Wright Brothers first took wing. A mere flight of artistic fancy? Or did Dellschau actually spend his lost years documenting wildly improbable inventions? Were the Aero Club's airships also responsible for many UFO sightings in America? ""The Secrets of Dellschau: The Sonora Aero Club & The Airships of The 1800s, a True Story"" is the first book-length account of Dellschau's life and work.","152.0","229.0","15.0","","","","1","9781933665351","1, black & white illustrations","3bf42e3d60172d8df57c852f79010ab3","full/2/c/5/2c5cc3f7d9e0fd8dec735ea5e04d79d83b7ae5a3.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9336/9781933665351.jpg","","","1933665351","9781933665351","en","2009-10-01 00:00:00","","3.9","10","THE Secrets of Dellschau : The Sonora Aero Club and the Airships of the 1800s, A True Story","/Secrets-Dellschau-Dennis-G-Crenshaw/9781933665351","387.0"

"[97]","1035632","[3241, 2842, 2848]","Tales of alien abductions, miraculous relics, and haunted castles have attracted believers and skeptics across the globe for centuries. Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell tackles the world's most seemingly inexplicable myths in  Adventures in Paranormal Investigation. With four decades of experience in the field, Nickell employs skepticism and scientific analysis to pull truth from the mires of false evidence and trickery that surround both old and new legends and mysteries. Unlike authors who engage in hype and sensationalism in order to foster or debunk myths, Nickell approaches each case with a rational and scientific approach intended to find the truth. Occam's Razor - all things being equal, the simplest solution is the best one - is a principal instrument in his investigative toolbox, as well as the belief that it is the claimant's responsibility to provide the extraordinary proof required in such extraordinary cases.  Adventures in Paranormal Investigation features Nickell's on-site explorations in unusual phenomena. Among the forty unique cases, Nickell examines mysteries ranging from snake charmers who purport to hold influence over the reptiles, to the Holocaust victims who reportedly haunt a gas chamber in Dachau, to Lake Simcoe's resident lake monster Igopogo in Canada. In addition to the case studies, Nickell analyzes how the propensity to fantasize can affect human perceptions of and belief in paranormal activity and how his personal experience with the paranormal was altered when intuition led to the discovery of a daughter he didn't know existed. More than just another myth-busting text,  Adventures in Paranormal Investigation brings together reason and scientific analyses to explain both the phenomena and the role of human perception therein, establishing Nickell as the foremost paranormal investigator of our time.","152.0","229.0","27.18","","","","3","9780813124674","68 photos","eb7fcef0ad446cfd248c548e680a9e3c","full/6/6/7/6671aae8338b6da83e0653551ffb638f64f69f06.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8131/9780813124674.jpg","","","813124670","9780813124674","en","2007-11-15 00:00:00","","3.39","51","Adventures in Paranormal Investigation","/Adventures-Paranormal-Investigation-Joe-Nickell/9780813124674","557.92"

The notion of a world beyond this one is firmly rooted into our popular culture, as countless strange phenomena in life point us toward this direction--from hauntings, to near-death experiences, and many more encounters with the ""beyond"". By venturing all the way through this rabbit-hole, Cyrus Kirkpatrick has come out from the other end, still with his marbles intact, and with the intention of finally putting all the pieces together to describe the reality behind what appears to be a multi-planar universe that we all exist as part of. A topic that must be ultimately rooted in science and not the New Age aisle, ""Understanding Life After Death"" is hopefully an attempt to push the subject in the right direction.","151.89","229.11","16.26","","","","1","9780692529171","","d5b41281e12da30e4b276ab1037b8cb8","full/4/1/6/41617e9c4991fc4911bae503d7f5e5efab916b8d.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6925/9780692529171.jpg","","","692529179","9780692529171","en","2015-09-06 00:00:00","","4.2","54","Understanding Life After Death","/Understanding-Life-After-Death-Cyrus-Kirkpatrick/9780692529171","412.77"
"[111]","","[2772, 2818, 2865]","Gut health, sugar diet, sugar detox, detox cleansing, health and nutrition, intestinal health, body cleansing, body detoxification and much more are all covered here in the detox cleanse program.  The information in this program contains accurate knowledge on: how to cleanse and reconstruct the small and large intestines completely and maintain a healthy internal system permanently. If you learn how, and apply what you learn, you will achieve just as the title reads-guaranteed!  What is mucoid plaque? Do an image search on ""mucoid plaque, bowel mucus, mucus rope"" and observe what comes up. More than 90% of diseases are diet and internal pollution related. The list would go on and on with all of the internal and external damage that unhealthy bowels cause.  What separates this program from the other internal detox programs? There are hundreds of internal cleansing programs available. Most programs can take up to months to complete, and even then mucoid plaque, parasites, and fungal overgrowth will only be marginally cleaned out. In this program, you will learn how to eradicate all of the mucoid plaque in a matter of days. You will not only cleanse the bowels but reconstruct/strengthen (what is missing from most internal cleansing programs) and transplant friendly bacteria to flourish for long periods of time.  What is in this program? This program is a step-by-step guide to cleanse the small and large intestines and reconstruct the intestinal delicate wall lining. If you desire to know what causes mucoid plaque buildup, excess body fat, alkaline body temperature, and everything to stay in optimal shape, all of this information is covered in my other program:   1. How to Burn Body Fat Completely and Maintain a Slim Physique Permanently 2. How to Build More Muscle than Ever before and Maintain Muscle Mass Permanently  The information in this program has been tested on myself and others who achieved outstanding results without harming the body.  Note:  Be warned...deep internal cleansing is a difficult process. It is far more difficult than losing weight or exercising alone. Deep tissue cleansing requires time, patience, persistence and disciplined effort that may be too much to handle for some.  But if you choose to follow through with the guidelines in these pages, your health, fitness, body and every area of your life will improve to new heights you would not have experienced in previously. Your body will feel light, free, and burst with energy knowing that the unnecessary waste/junk has been removed from your system.  Losing weight, staying lean and building muscle mass will become a more pleasurable process, and you will obtain greater results.  If you do not experience change after the completion of the cleanse, you will receive 100% of your money back, guaranteed!  Included in this program: Bonus: receive even more updates from Nekoterran.  This program is not a quick fix; it requires a few weeks of dedication and a lot of work on your part.  Required to successfully complete the program:  Spend $150+ on natural herbsMake dietary changesDedicate yourself for a few to the program (depending on your condition)Approach the program with an open mind and be open to new methods, and new ideasEnjoy optimal health  If you cannot commit to the above points 100%, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PROGRAM.This isn't a program for you!","127.0","203.0","3.0","","","","1","9781987723410","","b2365079f6748a7190e5868a1309f1b3","full/1/1/d/11d0ada3e36f41f85a030e6be9bacac1b0dcd84f.jpg","https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9877/9781987723410.jpg","","","1987723414","9781987723410","en","2017-03-25 00:00:00","","","","Intestinal cleanse and reconstruction : (black and white paperback version)","/Intestinal-cleanse-reconstruction-Nekoterran/9781987723410","74.0"
